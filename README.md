# Hello there 👋
Hey, I'm Lucas, I am really passionate about programming. I mainly focus on learning back-end development, but I also have a bit of interest and curiosity on front-end. I am currently 19 years old and determined to work with programming, willing to learn whatever is needed to do so.

I currently live in Brazil and Brazilian Portuguese is my mother language, but I can also communicate in English with relative ease.

## Fun Fact 👾
I first learned how to code back in 2015, when I was only 10 years old. That was because I wanted to make some fun games for me and my friends. Even though there are a lot of game engines out there and lots of better programming languages for this purpose, what I learned back then as my first programming language was Visual Basic, and it served me well in learning programming and for the kind of games that I did at the time.
